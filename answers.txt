1) I used the wget command to download minix because the image on the minix webpage for the most recent version wasn't working. I downloaded VirtualBox, I had to configure two settings before I was able to download the image on my virtual machine. I gave it 256mb of mem and 8 gb hard drive. Once the image was installed i logged into minix as root than rran setup used all of their default settings, then did a shutdown. After the installation, i had to delete the boot image from my virtual machine, then I was able to launch Minix.

2)The guy who created minix was Andrew S Tennenbaum, initials ast. When you create a new user it copies ast over with the new name you specify.

3) pkgin is the utility use pkgin install "package to download"

4)make hdboot

5)when booting, and when searching my files i haven't found "Minix 3.1.2a. Copyright"... anywhere. The Banner I do see after i boot is "Copyright (c) 2012, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands" which is located in usr/src/sys/conf/copyright
